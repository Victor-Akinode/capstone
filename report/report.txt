Detailed Report: Analysis of Brazilian E-Commerce Data Using dbt

Introduction

This report presents findings from the analysis of a Brazilian e-commerce dataset using dbt (Data Build Tool). The analysis aimed to answer three key questions:

	1.	Which product categories have the highest sales?
	2.	What is the average delivery time for orders?
	3.	Which states have the highest number of orders?

The data was modeled and transformed using dbt to derive these insights.

1. Which Product Categories Have the Highest Sales?

Process and Transformation:

Staging Models:

	•	stg_orders.sql: Extracted raw orders data, joining it with product information to associate orders with their respective categories.
	•	stg_products.sql: Extracted raw product data, focusing on product categories.

Intermediate Model:

	•	int_sales_by_category.sql: Aggregated sales data by summing up the total sales for each product category.

Final Model:

	•	fct_sales_by_category.sql: Produced the final sales figures for each product category.

Findings:

The table below lists the top product categories by total sales:

Product Category                            Total Sales (BRL)
Health_beauty                                 1347468.48999995
watches_gifts                                 1259634.57999999
bed_bath_table                                1228795.45999998
computers_accessories                         1135454.64000001
sports_leisure                                1082435.42000003

Conclusion: The Health_beauty category leads in total sales, indicating strong consumer demand in this segment.

2. What is the Average Delivery Time for Orders?

Process and Transformation:

Staging Models:

	•	stg_orders.sql: Captured the order placement and delivery dates.
	•	stg_order_reviews.sql: Provided additional context on delivery timings from customer reviews.

Intermediate Model:

	•	int_avg_delivery_time.sql: Calculated the time difference between order placement and delivery.

Final Model:

	•	fct_avg_delivery_time.sql: Provided the average delivery time across all orders.

Findings:

The answer below shows the average delivery time for orders:
12 days 13:24:31.879068


3. Which States Have the Highest Number of Orders?

Process and Transformation:

Staging Models:

	•	stg_orders.sql: Extracted order data, including delivery addresses indicating the state.
	•	stg_customers.sql: Ensured orders could be attributed to specific states.

Intermediate Model:

	•	int_orders_by_state.sql: Aggregated orders by state to determine regional distribution.

Final Model:

	•	fct_orders_by_state.sql: Presented the total number of orders per state.

Findings:

The table below lists the states with the highest number of orders:

customer_state	number_of_orders
SP	                41746
RJ	                12852
MG	                11635
RS	                5466    
PR	                5045
SC	                3637

Conclusion: São Paulo (SP) has the highest number of orders, reflecting its status as a major economic hub in Brazil.
